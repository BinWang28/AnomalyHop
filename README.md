# AnomalyHop: An SSL-based Image Anomaly Localization Method

Implementation for our paper. The paper can be found at [AnomalyHop](https://arxiv.org/).

## 1. Install Requirements / Environmen

We provide the environment setup information for virtual environment (anacodna). The environment can be easily install with (conda required):
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate AnomalyHop
```

## 2. Dataset Preparation

MVTec AD datasets can be downloaded from: [MVTec website](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad/)

It can also be downloaded by using our following commands:
```
cd datasets
wget ftp://guest:GU.205dldo@ftp.softronics.ch/mvtec_anomaly_detection/mvtec_anomaly_detection.tar.xz
tar -xf mvtec_anomaly_detection.tar.xz
cd ..
```
